            <summary>
            The Average Directional Index measures the strength of a prevailing trend as well as whether movement exists in the market. The ADX is measured on a scale of 0  100. A low ADX value (generally less than 20) can indicate a non-trending market with low volumes whereas a cross above 20 may indicate the start of a trend (either up or down). If the ADX is over 40 and begins to fall, it can indicate the slowdown of a current trend.

            Average Directional Movement Rating quantifies momentum change in the ADX. It is calculated by adding two values of ADX (the current value and a value n periods back), then dividing by two. This additional smoothing makes the ADXR slightly less responsive than ADX. The interpretation is the same as the ADX; the higher the value, the stronger the trend.

            The Ease of Movement (EMV) indicator emphasizes days in which the stock is moving easily and minimizes the days in which the stock is finding it difficult to move. A buy signal is generated when the EMV crosses above zero, a sell signal when it crosses below zero. When the EMV hovers around zero, then there are small price movements and/or high volume, which is to say, the price is not moving easily.

            <summary>
            The Forecast Oscillator (FOSC) is an extension of the linear regression based indicators made popular by Tushar Chande. The Forecast Oscillator plots the percentage difference between the forecast price (generated by an x-period linear regression line) and the actual price. The oscillator is above zero when the forecast price is greater than the actual price.  Conversely, it's less than zero if its below. In the rare case when the forecast price and the actual price are the same, the oscillator would plot zero. Actual prices that are persistently below the forecast price suggest lower prices ahead.  Likewise, actual prices that are persistently above the forecast price suggest higher prices ahead. Short-term traders should use shorter time periods and perhaps more relaxed standards for the required length of time above or below the forecast price. Long-term traders should use longer time periods and perhaps stricter standards for the required length of time above or below the forecast price. Chande also suggests plotting a three-day moving average trigger line of the Forecast Oscillator to generate early warnings of changes in trend. When the oscillator crosses below the trigger line, lower prices are suggested. When the oscillator crosses above the trigger line, higher prices are suggested.

            The VMA (Variable Moving Average, also known as VIDYA or Variable Index Dynamic Average) is an exponential moving average that automatically adjusts the smoothing weight based on the volatility of the data series. VMA solves a problem with most moving averages. In times of low volatility, such as when the price is trending, the moving average time period should be shorter to be sensitive to the inevitable break in the trend. Whereas, in more volatile non-trending times, the moving average time period should be longer to filter out the choppiness. VIDYA uses the CMO indicator for it's internal volatility calculations. Both the VMA and the CMO period are adjustable.

            <summary>
            The Average Directional Index measures the strength of a prevailing trend as well as whether movement exists in the market. The ADX is measured on a scale of 0  100. A low ADX value (generally less than 20) can indicate a non-trending market with low volumes whereas a cross above 20 may indicate the start of a trend (either up or down). If the ADX is over 40 and begins to fall, it can indicate the slowdown of a current trend.

            Average Directional Movement Rating quantifies momentum change in the ADX.

            The Ease of Movement (EMV) indicator emphasizes days in which the stock is moving easily and minimizes the days in which the stock is finding it difficult to move. A buy signal is generated when the EMV crosses above zero, a sell signal when it crosses below zero. When the EMV hovers around zero, then there are small price movements and/or high volume, which is to say, the price is not moving easily.

            <summary>
            The Forecast Oscillator (FOSC) is an extension of the linear regression based indicators made popular by Tushar Chande. The Forecast Oscillator plots the percentage difference between the forecast price (generated by an x-period linear regression line) and the actual price. The oscillator is above zero when the forecast price is greater than the actual price.  Conversely, it's less than zero if its below. In the rare case when the forecast price and the actual price are the same, the oscillator would plot zero. Actual prices that are persistently below the forecast price suggest lower prices ahead.  Likewise, actual prices that are persistently above the forecast price suggest higher prices ahead. Short-term traders should use shorter time periods and perhaps more relaxed standards for the required length of time above or below the forecast price. Long-term traders should use longer time periods and perhaps stricter standards for the required length of time above or below the forecast price. Chande also suggests plotting a three-day moving average trigger line of the Forecast Oscillator to generate early warnings of changes in trend. When the oscillator crosses below the trigger line, lower prices are suggested. When the oscillator crosses above the trigger line, higher prices are suggested.

            The VMA (Variable Moving Average, also known as VIDYA or Variable Index Dynamic Average) is an exponential moving average that automatically adjusts the smoothing weight based on the volatility of the data series. VMA solves a problem with most moving averages. In times of low volatility, such as when the price is trending, the moving average time period should be shorter to be sensitive to the inevitable break in the trend. Whereas, in more volatile non-trending times, the moving average time period should be longer to filter out the choppiness. VIDYA uses the CMO indicator for it's internal volatility calculations. Both the VMA and the CMO period are adjustable.

            <summary>
            The Average Directional Index measures the strength of a prevailing trend as well as whether movement exists in the market. The ADX is measured on a scale of 0  100. A low ADX value (generally less than 20) can indicate a non-trending market with low volumes whereas a cross above 20 may indicate the start of a trend (either up or down). If the ADX is over 40 and begins to fall, it can indicate the slowdown of a current trend.

            Average Directional Movement Rating quantifies momentum change in the ADX.

The interpretation is the same as the ADX; the higher the value, the stronger the trend.

            The Ease of Movement (EMV) indicator emphasizes days in which the stock is moving easily and minimizes the days in which the stock is finding it difficult to move. A buy signal is generated when the EMV crosses above zero, a sell signal when it crosses below zero. When the EMV hovers around zero, then there are small price movements and/or high volume, which is to say, the price is not moving easily.

            <summary>
            The Forecast Oscillator (FOSC) is an extension of the linear regression based indicators made popular by Tushar Chande. The Forecast Oscillator plots the percentage difference between the forecast price (generated by an x-period linear regression line) and the actual price. The oscillator is above zero when the forecast price is greater than the actual price.  Conversely, it's less than zero if its below. In the rare case when the forecast price and the actual price are the same, the oscillator would plot zero. Actual prices that are persistently below the forecast price suggest lower prices ahead.  Likewise, actual prices that are persistently above the forecast price suggest higher prices ahead. Short-term traders should use shorter time periods and perhaps more relaxed standards for the required length of time above or below the forecast price. Long-term traders should use longer time periods and perhaps stricter standards for the required length of time above or below the forecast price. Chande also suggests plotting a three-day moving average trigger line of the Forecast Oscillator to generate early warnings of changes in trend. When the oscillator crosses below the trigger line, lower prices are suggested. When the oscillator crosses above the trigger line, higher prices are suggested.

            The TSF (Time Series Forecast) calculates probable future values for the price by fitting a linear regression line over a given number of price bars and following that line forward into the future. A linear regression line is a straight line which is as close to all of the given price points as possible. Also see the Linear Regression indicator.

            The VMA (Variable Moving Average, also known as VIDYA or Variable Index Dynamic Average) is an exponential moving average that automatically adjusts the smoothing weight based on the volatility of the data series. VMA solves a problem with most moving averages. In times of low volatility, such as when the price is trending, the moving average time period should be shorter to be sensitive to the inevitable break in the trend. Whereas, in more volatile non-trending times, the moving average time period should be longer to filter out the choppiness. VIDYA uses the CMO indicator for it's internal volatility calculations. Both the VMA and the CMO period are adjustable.

            <summary>
            The Average Directional Index measures the strength of a prevailing trend as well as whether movement exists in the market. The ADX is measured on a scale of 0  100. A low ADX value (generally less than 20) can indicate a non-trending market with low volumes whereas a cross above 20 may indicate the start of a trend (either up or down). If the ADX is over 40 and begins to fall, it can indicate the slowdown of a current trend.

            <summary>
            Average Directional Movement Rating quantifies momentum change in the ADX. It is calculated by adding two values of ADX (the current value and a value n periods back), then dividing by two. This additional smoothing makes the ADXR slightly less responsive than ADX. The interpretation is the same as the ADX; the higher the value, the stronger the trend.

            The Dynamic Momentum Index is a variable term RSI. The RSI term varies from 3 to 30. The variable time period makes the RSI more responsive to short-term moves. The more volatile the price is, the shorter the time period is. It is interpreted in the same way as the RSI, but provides signals earlier.

When the EMV hovers around zero, then there are small price movements and/or high volume, which is to say, the price is not moving easily.

            The Forecast Oscillator (FOSC) is an extension of the linear regression based indicators made popular by Tushar Chande. The Forecast Oscillator plots the percentage difference between the forecast price (generated by an x-period linear regression line) and the actual price. The oscillator is above zero when the forecast price is greater than the actual price.  Conversely, it's less than zero if its below. In the rare case when the forecast price and the actual price are the same, the oscillator would plot zero. Actual prices that are persistently below the forecast price suggest lower prices ahead.  Likewise, actual prices that are persistently above the forecast price suggest higher prices ahead. Short-term traders should use shorter time periods and perhaps more relaxed standards for the required length of time above or below the forecast price. Long-term traders should use longer time periods and perhaps stricter standards for the required length of time above or below the forecast price. Chande also suggests plotting a three-day moving average trigger line of the Forecast Oscillator to generate early warnings of changes in trend. When the oscillator crosses below the trigger line, lower prices are suggested. When the oscillator crosses above the trigger line, higher prices are suggested.

The StochRSI computes the current position of the RSI relative to the high and low RSI values over a specified number of days. The intent of this measure, designed by Tushard Chande and Stanley Kroll, is to provide further information about the overbought/oversold nature of the RSI. The StochRSI ranges between 0.0 and 1.0. Values above 0.8 are generally seen to identify overbought levels and values below 0.2 are considered to indicate oversold conditions.

            The VMA (Variable Moving Average, also known as VIDYA or Variable Index Dynamic Average) is an exponential moving average that automatically adjusts the smoothing weight based on the volatility of the data series. VMA solves a problem with most moving averages. In times of low volatility, such as when the price is trending, the moving average time period should be shorter to be sensitive to the inevitable break in the trend. Whereas, in more volatile non-trending times, the moving average time period should be longer to filter out the choppiness. VIDYA uses the CMO indicator for it's internal volatility calculations. Both the VMA and the CMO period are adjustable.

            The Volume Oscillator measures volume by calculating the difference of a fast and a slow moving average of volume. The Volume Oscillator can provide insight into the strength or weakness of a price trend. A positive value suggests there is enough market support to continue driving price activity in the direction of the current trend. A negative value suggests there is a lack of support, that prices may begin to become stagnant or reverse.

             In the event that the breakout succeeds, which is less frequent than trading range days. Exit the position at IB range derived stop loss price
             In the event that a swing stop loss is hit, adjust the scalp portion, (which usually targets the open price, of the bar prior to the entry) to
             target the IB range profit target on the next entry. If the target is achieved the scalp portion goes back to normal. (An exit on close, where
             the profit target is not reaches, will not reset the orginal scalp target.
            
             Entry Probability is set to enter only if todays IB High/Low price is contained in the prior IB range and the ADX is within set tolerance.
             If current IB range completely engulfs the prior IB range, do no enter limit orders. Also, if the IB range is very small, the day potentially
             can be a breakout day and therefore the strategy is disabled.
